# Visualization 1

**CONS**

- Dual axes are generally a bad idea/can be confusing (although in some cases, I do think they're ok!)
- Axes are poorly labeled (what is "product's values")
- Colors might not be readable for someone who is color blind (unsure of this)
- Unclear what the goal of the figure is -- do we care more about comparing products or strategies? Maybe we need more than one figure to highlight key points
- Line charts imply time series, but strategies may not be time series

**PROS** 

- Could be ok as an exploratory figure, e.g. we make this to help us visualize if there are any trends across products/strategies and then we make a cleaner figure highlighting any trends

- Helps visualize relative scale of product values within strategies 

**UPDATED VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTION** 

In my visualization, I assumed the figure was trying to highlight the impact of strategies on the profits of a single product, product A. The figure is a stacked bar chart of the profits for product A & total profit from other products across strategies. I also added a baseline period for context. This obviously loses information about changes in profits of the other products across strategies, but depending on the context that may make the most sense.

# Visualization 2

**CONS**

- Everything??? 
- Way too much happening in one figure; unclear what the point of the figure is
- Unclear what the percentage labels mean and why some are boxed while others aren't
- Way too many colors
- No axes labels/title to help explain 

**PROS** 

- None

**UPDATED VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTION** 

I assumed the percentages were percent changes over time. I also assumed we were interested in how one company's (URGO's) market share in each of these markets changed over time. I used grey lines to display the changes for all of the companies and a dark blue line to show the changes for URGO. This helps visualize changes over time more clearly, however it does lose a lot of information, like the total size of the market, and it's less clear what the relative share of the market held by each company is. 

# Visualization 3

**CONS**

- The figure implies that these numbers are parts of a whole, but they aren't, so the shaded area seems to mean nothing here?
- Even if it was parts of a whole, it's impossible to judge relative amounts from a shaded area on a figure like this
- Results seem to be from a survey, but no details on sample size or survey population, which I'd like to see
- I really don't like the handwritten font for a final figure!

**PROS** 

- Unique/more eye catching than just a bar chart (though this doesn't mean much since there are so many other issues with the figure!)

**UPDATED VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTION** 

I decided to display the percentages in a series of waffle charts. This highlights that each value is a percentage of a total and allows us to assign a size for each square of the waffle, addressing the question of sample size. We could also add a note/caption to the figure about the survey population.
