## pros

- I like that they've labeled the percentages
- creative attempt putting the bars on a football field (but it makes the chart harder to read)
- I like the idea of the offseason vs regular season 
- I like the title and subtitle

## cons

- not immediately clear to that these are 100% stacked bars
- colors are hard to read
	- blue vs black/grey
	- green field background
	- white text on lighter colors
- not sure who the intended audience is or what the "platform average" is?
- I'd like to know the total number of unique users in addition to if they return

# gapminder

I'm a big fan of gapminder mostly because I really like Hans Rosling -- he has a great TED talk that incorporates gapminder :) 

## pros

- displays a lot of information in what I find to be a very clear way
- lots of flexbility to allow users to explore different relationships 
- ? buttons give more information on what the variables are and their source
- flexbility to select specific year and countries of interst
- animation is nice

## cons

- I would add the values to the tooltips 
- Maybe there's a few too many options? particularly for a less advanced user
